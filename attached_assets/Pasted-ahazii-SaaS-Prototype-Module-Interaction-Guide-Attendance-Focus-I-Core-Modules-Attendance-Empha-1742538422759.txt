ahazii SaaS Prototype Module Interaction Guide (Attendance Focus)

I. Core Modules (Attendance Emphasis):

Employee Management Module:
Manages employee records (basic data for prototype).
Simple data storage (e.g., in-memory or a basic JSON file within Replit).
Attendance Module:
Simulates clock-in/clock-out events (e.g., button clicks or form inputs).
Records simulated timestamps.
Calculates worked hours.
Determines presence, absence, and lateness based on a simulated work schedule.
Stores attendance data (e.g., in-memory or a basic JSON file).
Generates attendance reports (present, absent, late).
Reporting & Analytics Module (Basic):
Displays attendance reports (present, absent, late).
II. Workflow Interactions (Attendance Focus):

Clocking In/Out (Simulation):

Attendance Module: Provides UI elements (buttons/forms) to simulate clock-in/clock-out.
Attendance Module: Records simulated timestamps.
Attendance Module: Calculates worked hours.
Presence, Absence, and Lateness Detection:

Attendance Module: Retrieves simulated clock-in/clock-out times.
Attendance Module: Retrieves employee work schedule (simulated, e.g., start time of 9:00 AM).
Attendance Module:
If clock-in is within a small window after the scheduled start time (e.g., 9:00 AM to 9:15 AM), marks employee as "Present."
If clock-in is after the late window (e.g. after 9:15 AM), marks employee as "Late."
If no clock-in is recorded, marks employee as "Absent."
Attendance Module: Stores presence/absence/lateness data.
Attendance Reports:

Attendance Module: Generates reports based on presence, absence, and lateness data.
Attendance Module: Provides summaries (e.g., number of present, absent, late employees).
Reporting & Analytics Module: Displays the generated reports.
III. Data Storage (Attendance Focus):

For prototyping, you can use:
In-memory data structures (lists, dictionaries) for quick prototyping.
JSON files within Replit to store data persistently between runs (but not for production).
IV. Replit Implementation Tips (Attendance Focus):

Use Replit's HTML/CSS/JavaScript capabilities for the UI.
Use Replit's Python or Node.js capabilities for the backend logic.
Use simple data structures for data storage.
Implement a simulated work schedule (e.g., a fixed start time).
Use conditional logic to determine presence, absence, and lateness.
Display attendance reports in a clear and user-friendly format.
Example Implementation (Conceptual):

Python

# Simulated work schedule
scheduled_start_time = 9 * 60 # 9:00 AM in minutes

def process_attendance(employee_id, clock_in_time):
    if clock_in_time is None:
        return "Absent"
    elif clock_in_time <= scheduled_start_time + 15: # 15 minutes late window
        return "Present"
    else:
        return "Late"

# Example usage
clock_in_time = 9 * 60 + 10 # 9:10 AM
attendance_status = process_attendance(1, clock_in_time)
print(attendance_status) # Output: Present
UI Considerations:

Display a table or list of employees with their attendance status.
Provide filtering options (e.g., show only absent employees).
Display summaries (e.g., total present, absent, late).
By adding this attendance tracking with presence, absence, and lateness detection, you can create a more comprehensive and realistic prototype.
