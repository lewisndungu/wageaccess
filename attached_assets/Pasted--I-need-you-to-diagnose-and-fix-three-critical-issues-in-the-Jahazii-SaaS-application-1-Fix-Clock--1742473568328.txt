I need you to diagnose and fix three critical issues in the Jahazii SaaS application:
1. Fix Clock-In/Out Functionality
The current attendance system is encountering errors when users attempt to clock in or out. Please:
1. Diagnose the error source:
    * Check the console logs for specific error messages
    * Examine the request/response cycle for the clock-in/out API calls
    * Verify if the issue is in the frontend event handlers or backend processing
2. Implement error-resistant clock-in/out:
    * Add proper error handling with user-friendly messages
    * Implement retry mechanisms for failed requests
    * Fix the state updates after clock actions to ensure UI reflects changes
    * Ensure time values are properly formatted before submission
3. Add local fallback:
    * Create a mechanism to temporarily store attendance actions locally if API fails
    * Implement sync functionality to process stored actions when connection is restored
    * Provide clear status indicators during the process
2. Repair Payroll Processing
The payroll processing functionality is failing with errors. Please:
1. Identify processing failures:
    * Debug calculation errors in the payroll generation
    * Check for data type mismatches or null values breaking the calculations
    * Verify if attendance data is being properly pulled into payroll processing
2. Fix calculation logic:
    * Ensure proper handling of decimal precision for financial calculations
    * Correct the hours worked calculations based on attendance records
    * Fix EWA deduction logic and net pay calculations
    * Implement proper validation before processing
3. Improve error reporting:
    * Add step-by-step validation in the payroll process
    * Create meaningful error messages for specific failure points
    * Implement partial processing capability for valid records when some have errors
3. Resolve Employee Creation Issues
The employee creation page is not loading. Please:
1. Fix page loading issues:
    * Debug the initialization errors preventing the employee form from rendering
    * Check for missing dependencies or component errors
    * Verify route configuration and navigation to the employee creation page
2. Implement robust form handling:
    * Add progressive loading of form sections to prevent complete failure
    * Implement field-level validation to identify problematic inputs
    * Create a simplified employee creation flow as fallback if full form fails
3. Add data validation:
    * Ensure all required fields are properly validated before submission
    * Implement type checking for all employee data fields
    * Add unique identifier verification to prevent duplicate entries
Implementation Approach
When fixing these issues, please:
1. Use defensive programming techniques:
    * Add try/catch blocks around critical functionality
    * Implement proper null checking before accessing properties
    * Add default values for all calculations and operations
2. Improve feedback mechanisms:
    * Show clear loading states during operations
    * Provide specific error messages that guide users on how to resolve issues
    * Add success confirmations after operations complete
3. Ensure cross-browser compatibility:
    * Test fixes in multiple browsers
    * Use standard JavaScript methods instead of newer features that might not be supported
    * Validate all date/time handling works consistently
The fixes should maintain the existing design language and integrate seamlessly with the rest of the application. Focus on making these core functions robust and error-resistant while providing meaningful feedback to users when issues occur.
