Create a comprehensive Jahazii SaaS application that integrates all modules into a cohesive, logically connected system. The application should feature seamless navigation between components and consistent data flow throughout the platform.
System-Wide Integration
Implement a central architecture that:

Creates a unified data ecosystem connecting:

Employee management system
Attendance tracking
Payroll calculations
Earned Wage Access (EWA) functionality
Self-Log features


Establishes logical workflows between modules:

Attendance data directly influences payroll calculations
Employee information feeds into all other systems
EWA requests reference available earned wages from attendance/payroll
Self-log actions update attendance which affects payroll and EWA availability


Maintains consistent state management for:

User authentication and role-based access
Current pay period context
Organization structure (departments, reporting lines)
System-wide notifications and alerts



Cross-Module Functionality
Implement connections between key business processes:

Employee Lifecycle Management:

New employee creation triggers setup across all modules
Department changes affect reporting in attendance and payroll
Inactive status properly reflected in all systems


Financial Calculations Flow:

Attendance records → Hours worked → Gross pay calculation
EWA requests → Available balance reduction → Net pay adjustment
Wallet transactions → Disbursement records → Financial reporting


Reporting Consistency:

Standardized date ranges across all reporting interfaces
Unified export formats and data structures
Consistent metrics and KPIs throughout dashboards



Unified User Experience
Create a consistent experience across the application:

Global Navigation System:

Sidebar navigation with logical grouping of related functions
Contextual sub-navigation within each major section
Breadcrumb trails showing relationship between screens
Quick action shortcuts to related functions


Common UI Patterns:

Consistent card layouts, data tables, and form designs
Standardized status indicators and color-coding
Unified confirmation flows and error handling
Shared component library for all modules


Responsive Design Strategy:

Adaptive layouts that prioritize different functions on mobile vs. desktop
Touch-optimized interfaces for field employees
Manager-focused desktop experiences for complex tasks



Data Synchronization
Implement robust data management across modules:

Real-Time Updates:

Attendance changes immediately reflect in payroll projections
EWA disbursements instantly update available balances
Employee status changes propagate throughout the system


Historical Data Consistency:

Attendance corrections properly update historical payroll records
Audit trails for all financial transactions across modules
Version control for important documents and calculations
