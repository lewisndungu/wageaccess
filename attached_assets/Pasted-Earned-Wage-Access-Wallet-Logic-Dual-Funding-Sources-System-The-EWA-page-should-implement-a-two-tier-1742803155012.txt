Earned Wage Access Wallet Logic
Dual Funding Sources System
The EWA page should implement a two-tiered wallet system that clearly distinguishes between employer-funded advances and Jahazii-funded advances.
Employer Wallet Section

Display Features:

Current employer-funded wallet balance
Per-employee cap (3,000 KES) clearly indicated
Utilization metrics (e.g., "60% of allocated funds used")
Number of employees currently eligible for employer-funded advances


Top-up Interface:

Simple form to add funds to the employer wallet
Suggested funding amounts based on employee count
Payment processing integration
Transaction history of previous top-ups
Receipt generation for accounting purposes


Management Controls:

Ability to adjust per-employee caps (up to 3,000 KES maximum)
Options to prioritize specific departments or employee groups
Auto-replenishment settings (optional)
Set alerts for low balance thresholds



Jahazii Advances Section

Display Features:

Available Jahazii advance funding
Current utilization
Terms of service specific to Jahazii-funded advances
Cost structure (if applicable)
Statistics on recent usage


Administration Interface:

Review of pending Jahazii-funded advance requests
History of processed Jahazii advances
Option to adjust terms or availability
Analytics on Jahazii advance usage patterns



Transaction Processing Flow

Request Assessment:

When an employee requests an advance, the system first checks employer wallet availability
If the requested amount is within the employee's employer-funded limit (â‰¤ 3,000 KES) and funds are available, it's processed from employer wallet
If employer funds are insufficient or the request exceeds the employer cap, the system checks Jahazii advance eligibility


Approval Interface:

Clearly indicate which funding source will be used for each request
Allow manual override of funding source if needed
Batch process capabilities for multiple requests
Different approval workflows based on funding source


Dashboard Reporting:

Separate metrics for employer-funded vs. Jahazii-funded advances
Comparative usage statistics
Cost savings analysis
Projection of future needs based on current patterns



Employee-Facing Elements

Request Interface:

Transparent display of available amount from employer funds (up to 3,000 KES)
Clear indication of additional available amount from Jahazii advances
Any different terms or conditions between the two funding sources
Simplified application process that works for both funding types


History View:

Transaction history clearly indicating funding source for each advance
Repayment tracking distinguished by advance type
Available balance from each source



Visual Design Considerations

Color Coding:

Use distinct but complementary colors to differentiate employer funds and Jahazii advances
Consider using Jahazii's primary brand colors (blue and teal) for Jahazii advances
Use secondary brand colors for employer funds


Information Architecture:

Clear visual separation between the two funding sources
Progressive disclosure of details to avoid overwhelming users
Contextual help elements explaining the dual-funding model
Summary widgets showing combined availability and usage
