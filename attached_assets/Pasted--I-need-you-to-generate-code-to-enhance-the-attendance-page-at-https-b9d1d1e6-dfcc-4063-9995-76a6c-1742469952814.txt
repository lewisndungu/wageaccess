I need you to generate code to enhance the attendance page at https://b9d1d1e6-dfcc-4063-9995-76a6c0c42e10-00-3p3aiw3msfnvd.janeway.replit.dev/attendance, focusing specifically on two key modules:
1. Attendance Dashboard Enhancement
Create a React component that implements a comprehensive attendance overview dashboard with:

A tabbed interface for switching between Daily, Weekly, and Monthly views
Status cards showing attendance metrics:

Total employees present today
On-time vs late arrivals
Average check-in time
Attendance rate compared to previous period (with trend indicators)


A filterable data table of employees with columns for:

Employee name/ID
Department
Check-in time
Check-out time (if applicable)
Status indicator (Present, Absent, Late, Left Early)
Total hours worked


Visual charts showing:

Department-wise attendance percentages
Attendance trends over time (line chart)
Peak check-in hours (bar chart)


Search and filter functionality to find specific employees or departments
Export options for attendance reports

The dashboard should use the existing design language with glass-effect cards and Jahazii's color scheme.
2. Manager Attendance Controls
Implement a manager control panel component that enables:

Manual attendance management section with:

Employee search/selection functionality
Date/time selection for manual entries
Dropdown for attendance status (Present, Absent, Late, etc.)
Required reason field for manual entries
Submit and cancel buttons


Bulk attendance actions:

Department selection dropdown
Multi-select employee interface
Bulk status assignment
Reason field for bulk actions
Confirmation dialog before submission


Attendance correction tools:

Searchable list of recent attendance records
Edit functionality with change tracking
Approval workflow for corrections
Audit log of all manual changes


Real-time shift tracker:

Visual display of currently checked-in employees
Time elapsed since check-in
Expected check-out times
Break status indicators
Department grouping options



Ensure all components are responsive, accessible, and seamlessly integrate with the existing UI. Use proper state management, loading indicators, and error handling throughout. The components should follow the glass-card aesthetic seen elsewhere in the application and maintain Jahazii's brand colors.
